# NBADataProject

Basketball is a sport loved by many around the world, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) serving as the pinnacle of professional competition. With teams across North America, the NBA is home to players from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities. In this data analysis project, we will explore the journeys of how each player came to be in the NBA, examining which countries, colleges, and hometowns are most represented in the league. By visualizing this data and analyzing patterns, we can gain a deeper understanding of the global impact of the NBA and the cultural diversity that makes it so unique.

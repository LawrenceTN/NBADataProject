# NBADataProject

Basketball is a sport loved by many around the world, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) serving as the pinnacle of professional competition. With teams across North America, the NBA is home to players from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities. In this data analysis project, we will explore the journeys of how each player came to be in the NBA, examining which countries, colleges, and hometowns are most represented in the league. By visualizing this data and analyzing patterns, we can gain a deeper understanding of the global impact of the NBA and the cultural diversity that makes it so unique.

Over the past few decades, the NBA has seen a significant increase in the number of international players succeeding in the league. This trend has been fueled by several factors, including the globalization of basketball, the growth of international scouting and player development programs, and the increased exposure of the NBA through media and technology. Back in the 2002-2003 season, there were only 60 international players in the NBA. With this data, you can see that the total number of international players in 2023 has doubled at 121 players born outside the US. Today, international-born players make up **23%** of the NBA's player population.

Many of these international players bring unique skill sets and playing styles that have helped them thrive in the NBA. For example, players from Europe and Australia tend to have strong fundamentals and team-oriented play, while players from Africa and South America often have impressive athleticism and physicality.

Some of the most successful international players in recent years include Dirk Nowitzki from Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo from Greece, Nikola Jokic from Serbia, and Luka Doncic from Slovenia. These players have not only achieved individual success, but have also helped to elevate the level of play and popularity of the NBA around the world.
